# Performing a Linux migration to Azure with CloudEndure

## Expected Outcome

This challenge will give you practical experience migrating a running virtual machine to Azure. Inside the CentOS Linux host that you are using as your desktop, there is a running virtual machine entitled "migrate-host".  It, too, is a CentOS virtual machine running under the KVM hypervisor on your host. Microsoft has partnered with CloudEndure to provide access to their migration tool to showcase the process and give you hands-on experience with the migration process.  At the end of the lab, you should have a new virtual machine created in Azure which you can SSH to and verify that it is, indeed, the same host.
